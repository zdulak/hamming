# hamming

The solution of the coding problem from the website: <https://exercism.org/tracks/scala/exercises/hamming>

Calculate the Hamming Distance.
The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length, so an attempt to calculate it between sequences of different lengths should not work.
